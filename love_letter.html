    <h1>Hi baby,</h1>

    <p>I know you felt like I was so relaxed and calm about Valentine’s Day, acted like it’s just another date on the calendar, but I very well know it ain't. Reason is because you’re not ordinary to me, and what we have is not ordinary either. ❤️</p>

    <p>Sometimes I sit quietly and replay the moments we’ve had together — the way it felt to finally see you in person (of course you wanted it to happen sooner, but I guess everything happened at just the right time), the way time moved too fast, the way your presence made the world feel softer. I still remember how I looked at you and realized, oh… this is real — not an idea, not a fantasy, not a maybe. You were there, in front of me. I felt something settle inside me that I can’t explain without sounding dramatic; it was like my heart finally recognized its own language. 💗</p>

    <p>And now that we’re apart again, I feel it even more because distance does a strange thing. It makes love louder, and small memories heavier. It turns the simplest things into cravings — your voice, your laugh, your face close to mine, the warmth of you when you’re relaxed and not pretending to be tough. I miss you in ways I didn’t expect. Not just emotionally, but physically too. 🥺</p>

    <p>I’m not writing this to be perfect. I’m writing because I don’t want you to ever wonder where you stand with me. I admire you — your softness, your confidence, the way you carry yourself, the way you’re both sweet and bougie in the best way. I love the way you’re you: the kind of woman who can be gentle without being weak, and beautiful without trying too hard. And I want you to know something; I don’t take you lightly. 💘</p>

    <p>I know we met late last year and we’ve only had a few chances to be together in person. But those moments weren’t small to me. They were enough to show me what this could be — what it already is. And yes, I miss you. I want you. I want more time, more days, more nights, more moments where I don’t have to count down the hours until I have to let you go again. 💞</p>

    <p>But since I can’t do that right now, I’ll do the next best thing: showing up for you. I’ll keep being consistent, and being honest. I’ll keep loving you in the ways I can, until I get to love you in the ways I want. 💖</p>

    <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. 🌹</p>

    
      With all my love,<br>
      Your baby ❤️
